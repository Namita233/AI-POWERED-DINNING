AI-Powered Dining Recommendation System is a Flask-based web application that recommends food items based on the user’s mood and preferences. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis (NLTK) to understand user input and provide suitable food suggestions. The project demonstrates the practical integration of AI concepts with a simple web interface using Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS, making it suitable as an academic mini project and for interview discussions.
